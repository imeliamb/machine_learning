# Machine Learning Project

## 1. KN classifier

 1.1 Training data with up to 3 layers [orhs3]
 
 1.2 Training data with up to 3 layers, with noise [orhs3-noise]
 
 1.3 Compare the results from 1.1 and 1.2
 
 1.4 Repeat with up to 4 layers [orhs4 and orhs4-noise]
 
## 2. R(q) to layer parameters (with noise)

 2.1 Convolutional Neural network for single layer
 
 2.2 CNN for two layers
 
 2.3 CNN for three layers
 
 2.4 CNN for four layers
 
## 3. Analyzer script
  3.1 Write a script that takes an R(Q) curve and predicts how many layers and what the parameters are.
  
  3.2 Same as 3.1, but ranks best solutions.
