# Machine Learning Project

## 1. KN classifier

 1.1 Training data with up to 3 layers [orhs3]  *done*

 1.2 Training data with up to 3 layers, with noise [orhs3-noise]  *done*
 
 1.3 Compare the results from 1.1 and 1.2 *done*
 
 1.4 Repeat with up to 4 layers [orhs4 and orhs4-noise] *done*

 1.5 Produce confusion matrix for both with and without noise
 
## 2. R(q) to layer parameters (without noise)

 2.1 Convolutional Neural network for single layer *done*
 
 2.2 CNN for two layers *done*
 
 2.3 CNN for three layers *done*
 
 2.4 CNN for four layers *done*
 
## 3. Analyzer script
 3.1 Write a script that takes an R(Q) curve and predicts how many layers and what the parameters are. *done*

 3.2 Write script to overplot real and predicted R(Q) and SLD curves
  
 3.3 Same as 3.1, but ranks best solutions. Compare top 2 soloutions with 3.2 and compute residuals for each

## 4. Results
 4.1 Run the analyzer on 1, 2, 3, and 4 layers of assimilated data sets to assess quality of results

 4.1.1 Overplot SLD and R(Q) curves for when the predicted number of layers is wrong

 4.1.2 For data with accurate prediction of number of layers produce correlation plot for all parameters
  
 4.2 Revisit networks in 2 as needed. Add noise if needed
  
 4.3 Test on real data and compare to manual model
